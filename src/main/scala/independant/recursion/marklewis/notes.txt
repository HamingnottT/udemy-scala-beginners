Using factorial as an example:

The basic way of representing a factorial of n:
    
    n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n

This can be great for abstracting out the relationship idea, but there are more advanced ways to go about this:

         n
    n! = Πi
        i=1

Like using sumation notation, this notation represents repeated multiplication, still there is another way:

Recursive mathematical notation in of factorial:

            1               if n < 2    (base case)
         /
    n! = 
         \
            n * (n - 1)!     otherwise

The base case is critical for the recursive function to terminate its loop

Another example:

    f(n) = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + ... + n^2

    also represented as

           n
    f(n) = Σi^2
           i=1

    recursively represented as

              1                 if n > 2
            /
    f(n) =
            \
              n^2 + f(n - 1)    otherwise


As recursion the function calls itself, the condition of n gets closer and closer to the base case.
once the value of n reaches the base case the function terminates
